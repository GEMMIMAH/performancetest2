And if you will visit my album in my phone there are more pictures of anything, candid photograph, flowers, seas than my own pictures or selfies. Also, I like riding motorcycles it made me satisfied whenever I rode some. It feels like it is one of my happiness. Listening music. For me it is one of the main and biggest sources of my inspiration and peace of mind aside from going to seashore. Recently I listen the songs of K-POP girl group TWICE.</p>
